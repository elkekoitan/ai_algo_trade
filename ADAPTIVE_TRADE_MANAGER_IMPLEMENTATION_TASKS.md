# 🛡️ ADAPTIVE TRADE MANAGER - Implementation Tasks

## Overview
Implementing an AI-powered system to dynamically manage open positions based on real-time market conditions, optimizing for risk and profit.

## Phase 1: Backend Foundation (Week 1-2)

### Task 1.1: Create Module Structure
- [ ] Create `backend/modules/adaptive_trade_manager/` directory.
- [ ] Create `__init__.py`, `models.py`, `position_monitor.py`, `risk_calculator.py`, `market_analyzer.py`, `optimization_engine.py`, `alert_manager.py`.

### Task 1.2: Implement Data Models
- [ ] In `models.py`, define Pydantic models: `ManagedPosition`, `RiskMetrics`, `MarketCondition`, `AdaptiveAction`, `AdaptiveAlert`.
- [ ] Add enums for `RiskLevel` (Low, Medium, High, Critical), `MarketRegime` (Trending, Ranging, Volatile), `ActionType` (AdjustSL, AdjustTP, PartialClose, Hedge).

### Task 1.3: Position Monitor Service
- [ ] In `position_monitor.py`, create a service to track open positions.
- [ ] Integrate with `MT5Service` to fetch positions in real-time.
- [ ] Implement a loop to continuously update position data (P&L, duration).

### Task 1.4: Market Analyzer Service
- [ ] In `market_analyzer.py`, create a service to assess market conditions.
- [ ] Implement volatility calculation (e.g., using ATR).
- [ ] Integrate a news event calendar (e.g., from a third-party API or a static file).
- [ ] Develop a market regime detection algorithm.

## Phase 2: Risk & AI Engine (Week 3-4)

### Task 2.1: Risk Calculator Service
- [ ] In `risk_calculator.py`, implement dynamic risk calculations.
- [ ] Calculate VaR (Value at Risk) for each position.
- [ ] Develop a risk scoring system based on volatility, news, and correlation.
- [ ] Implement drawdown monitoring.

### Task 2.2: AI Decision Engine
- [ ] In `optimization_engine.py`, create the core AI logic.
- [ ] Build a rule-based engine for initial recommendations (e.g., if volatility > X, tighten SL).
- [ ] Develop a simple machine learning model (e.g., a classifier) to predict optimal actions based on market/risk data.
- [ ] Implement logic for generating `AdaptiveAction` recommendations.

### Task 2.3: Alert Manager
- [ ] In `alert_manager.py`, create a service to manage and push alerts.
- [ ] Implement logic to generate `AdaptiveAlert` objects based on triggers from the AI engine.
- [ ] Set up a queue (e.g., using Redis Pub/Sub or a simple list) to handle alerts.

## Phase 3: API & Frontend (Week 5-6)

### Task 3.1: Create API Endpoints
- [ ] Create `backend/api/v1/adaptive_trade_manager.py`.
- [ ] Implement `GET /atm/positions` to fetch all managed positions with their risk metrics.
- [ ] Implement `GET /atm/dashboard` to get an overview of portfolio risk.
- [ ] Implement `POST /atm/actions/{position_id}` to execute a recommended action.
- [ ] Implement a WebSocket endpoint `/ws/atm/alerts` to stream real-time alerts to the frontend.
- [ ] Integrate the new router into `main.py`.

### Task 3.2: Create Frontend Components
- [ ] Create `frontend/components/adaptive-trade-manager/` directory.
- [ ] Build `TradeMonitor.tsx`: A component to display live position cards with P&L and risk scores.
- [ ] Build `RiskDashboard.tsx`: A component with charts for portfolio risk, volatility, etc.
- [ ] Build `AdaptiveControls.tsx`: A panel within each position card to show AI recommendations and allow one-click execution.
- [ ] Build `AlertCenter.tsx`: A toast/notification system to display incoming alerts.

### Task 3.3: Create Main Page
- [ ] Create `frontend/app/adaptive-trade-manager/page.tsx`.
- [ ] Assemble all frontend components into a cohesive dashboard.
- [ ] Implement WebSocket client to connect to the alerts endpoint.
- [ ] Fetch and display data from the API endpoints.

## Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Week 7)

### Task 4.1: End-to-End Integration
- [ ] Connect backend services (Monitor -> Analyzer -> Risk Calc -> AI Engine -> Alerter).
- [ ] Ensure frontend components correctly display data from the backend.
- [ ] Test the full action-execution loop from alert to MT5 order.

### Task 4.2: Add Navigation
- [ ] Add a link to `/adaptive-trade-manager` in `QuantumHeader.tsx`.

### Task 4.3: Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for risk calculation and AI decision logic.
- [ ] Write integration tests for the API endpoints.
- [ ] Perform manual end-to-end testing of the user flow.

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies to Add
- No major new dependencies are expected as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `numpy` are already in `requirements.txt`.

### Environment Variables
- `NEWS_API_KEY` (optional, for a real news feed).

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Risk-adjusted return improvement: Target >15%.
- Drawdown reduction: Target >20%.
- Alert generation latency: < 500ms from market event.

### Usage Metrics
- User adoption of AI recommendations: > 50%.
- Reduction in significant losses due to ATM intervention.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1.  **Latency:** Real-time processing can be slow.
    -   **Solution:** Use efficient calculations, async operations, and caching.
2.  **Model Accuracy:** AI model may give poor recommendations.
    -   **Solution:** Start with a conservative rule-based system and require user confirmation for all actions. Log decisions for future model training.

### Operational Risks
1.  **Over-optimization:** AI may over-manage trades.
    -   **Solution:** Implement thresholds to prevent excessive adjustments.
2.  **Black Swan Events:** AI may not handle unprecedented events well.
    -   **Solution:** Include an emergency "Manual Only" mode to disable the ATM.
