        self.migration_percentage = 0  # Start with 0%
    
    async def authenticate(self, request):
        if self.should_use_edge(request):
            return await self.edge_auth(request)
        else:
            return await self.traditional_auth.authenticate(request)
    
    def should_use_edge(self, request):
        # Gradually migrate users to edge authentication
